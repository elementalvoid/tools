Tools for Apache mod_rewrite.

Purpose:
  Take in a file with a list of useragent strings and process them against
  a mod_rewrite config file to determine which User Agents would be affected
  by the config. This is meant to search for RedirectCond directives and
  list which directives would cause an action on the User Agent.

Usage:
  Execute the script with no arguments to get usage info.

rewritematch.pl:
  Will process a rewrite.conf file and a file containing user agent strings.

rewritematch_logs.pl:
  Will directly process an Apache log file pulling out the user agent string
  and process them against the rewrite.conf.
